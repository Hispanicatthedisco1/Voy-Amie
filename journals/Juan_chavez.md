10/23/2023 - 10/27/2023

This week I:
   -Added a navigation from create trips to users profile.

  -Added back end and front end authorization for the Final Trips page

 -Updated the Read Me

 -Added Landing Page

Bugs encountered:
    - upon creating a trip navigate to the users profile was not working on deployment, originally I had tried to add to the handleSubmit but was receiving and error about conflicting handleSubmits so I instead tried windows.location.href="/profile" which worked in localhost but would not work on deployment so I fixed it by using the useNavigate hook.

Any blockers:
   Authorization was quite difficult and the bug with the navigate took me a second to figure out

Next week:
    we will finalize styling.
