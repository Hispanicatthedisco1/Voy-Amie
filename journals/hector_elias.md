Today, my group and I worked on:
    + creating database tables
    + creating our first endpoint to create a user

We took turns throughout the process with coding, watching, creating the issues and merge requests on gitlab. This finally allowed me to learn interactively. My team and I collaborate well and were able to tackle any of the issues we came across in good time.
We kept having to prune and rebuild our containers and volumes during the part we had to migrate after each table creation.
Before we started the creation of our first endpoint, we took some time to watch the educational video on the subject from last week's exploration. THis really helped us refresh our minds on how to go about creating an endpoint with FastAPI.
I was very excited when I was able to find the solution to a postgres issue we ran into while trying to troubleshoot on Beekeeper! It reminded me that no matter how stuck I am, I can always find the solution so long as I know what to look for.
